# Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Objective
To perform a complete Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) cycle on a lab environment using open-source tools.

---

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Metasploit Framework

---

## Workflow and Steps

### Step 1: Network Scanning
- Identified live host using Nmap
- Enumerated open ports and services

Command used:
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.56.100
Step 2: Web Vulnerability Scanning
Performed web scan using Nikto

Identified outdated Apache, missing headers, directory listing

Command used:

bash
Copy code
nikto -h http://192.168.56.100
Step 3: Vulnerability Analysis
Prioritized vulnerabilities using CVSS scoring

Validated findings manually to avoid false positives

Step 4: Exploitation
Used Metasploit to exploit Samba vulnerability

Achieved remote command execution with root access

Exploit used:

bash
Copy code
exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
Step 5: Post-Exploitation
Verified root access

Collected evidence from target system

Generated SHA256 hash to maintain integrity

Command used:

bash
Copy code
sha256sum evidence.txt
Result
The target system was successfully compromised with root-level access, proving the presence of critical security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion
This task demonstrates the importance of regular vulnerability assessments and timely patching to prevent system compromise.
